# Australian Tattoo Expo

This is the front-end for the Australian Tattoo Expo website. Created with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. Install Globally

   - [NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
   - [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli)
   - [Semantic Release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)

1. Grab the environment variables from the vercel server by running

   ```bash
   vercel env pull
   ```

## 🔨 Development

### 🖥️ Frontend

Start the development server by running

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

### 📺 Backend

Make sure that you have the Wordpress backend server running locally.

## 🛠 Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project.
